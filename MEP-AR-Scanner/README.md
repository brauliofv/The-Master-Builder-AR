# 🏗️ The Master Builder AR

**The Master Builder AR** is a cutting-edge native Android application designed for AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) professionals. It leverages **ARCore Depth API** and **BIM logic** to provide offline 3D scanning, real-time MEP installation validation, and automatic Bill of Materials (BOM) generation.

Optimized for high-performance devices like the **Samsung S23**, this app ensures high-precision sensor fusion and a fluid 120Hz AR experience.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Offline 3D MEP Scanning**: Map Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing installations directly on-site without needing an internet connection.
- **AI Standard Heights Engine**: A built-in database of standard installation heights (Kitchen, Bathroom, etc.) that triggers visual warnings if components are placed incorrectly.
- **Automated BOM (Bill of Materials)**: Real-time tracking of pipes, wires, boxes, and fixtures. Export your inventory instantly.
- **Architectural Audit (Hybrid)**: Export your BIM data to JSON and leverage high-order LLMs (like Gemini Pro) for technical reports and optimization tips.
- **Immersive AR UI**: Reactive 3D billboards, animated flow shaders for hydraulic systems, and layered wiring visualization.
